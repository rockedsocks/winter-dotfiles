#### Disclaimer
**First off, I'm quite new to ricing. So don't expect anything fancy.**

## Installing/Using
Dependencies:
- i3-gaps
- picom
- [wpg](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjsttL2_on3AhUtSPEDHfU8B8kQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdeviantfero%2Fwpgtk&usg=AOvVaw0SWOvVv64rQS7xwZbO6A-0) for theming the wallpaper. I have included my session file. (not nescessary)

Thats about it. I have commented out some lines in the picom.conf because my craptop can't handle the blur effects. I also use the Nord GTK theme, and my "colorscheme" works well with Nord.
